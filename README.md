# web_scraper

This project Loops through multiple pages adding the page index to the url as a string,
then uses beautiful soup module to convert link to text and pass through to HTML parser,
shortly after the soup.select attribute is assigned to select the hyperlinked urls. 
The subtext class is assigned to select the votes. 

There are right ways and wrong ways to scrape the internet for data and this is hopefully an example of how to use that data to enhance the existing platforms.
